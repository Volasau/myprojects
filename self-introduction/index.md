Hi.
I am glad you are watching the video. That video is about myself.

I am Gregory and I was born and raised in Gomel, Belarus.
I had spent all my live there before I left it in 2022 for Batumi, Georgia.
I graduated from Gomel Polytechnic with a bachelor's degree in engineering.
So I am an agricultural machine engineer.
After that I had a small auto parts businesses for 17 years and I was a seller on a local market.

I have a great family, my wife and two sons.
I love my family very much. My family is my strength.

One of my hobbies is sport.
I jog every morning and go boxing twice a week.

I have been studying in RS school from last December and I am keen on programming very much.
I like Java Script because it helps me to create interactive web applications and it is one of the most reliable programming languages nowadays.
Also, I am interested in the language because I can see the results of my implementation right away on the screen.
I believe with JS I can persuade my career in IT very quickly.
My aim is to finish RS school successfully and find my first job as a frontend developer.

That's all I wanted to say.
Thanks for your attention.
